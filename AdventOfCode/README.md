These are my solutions Advent of Code challenges. They are completed in c#. When possible I have optomized the solutions to the best of my ability.

To run a day, run the program and enter a year followed by a space then a day.

For example:
2018 5

Would run Day 5 of year 2018 challenges.

To get an accurate speed for the days completed enter another space and a "p" at the end

For example:
2018 5 p

This will run the day 10 times consecutively and get a average time it takes.
